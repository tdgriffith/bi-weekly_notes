## My Thoughts on Application
| Probability | State        | Accelerate | Decelerate | Stop  | Constant |
|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|----------|
|  .95        | Red Light    | 0          | 9          | 9     | 0        |
| .03         | Yellow Light | 3          | 3          | 0     | 9        |
|  .02        | Green Light  | 1          | 0          | 0     |  9       |
|             | Importance   | 0.6%       | 48.7%      | 48.2% | 2.53%    |

## Open Questions
- Is a single row-sum operation sufficient?
  - Can we assign math meaning to the roof?
- How to shift in time?
  - Discrete system?
- Algorithm to fill matrix:
  - ANN is obvious
  - Simple stats ok too       
- Literature is **very** sparse
- Dedicating independent matricies
